LaBaties Editor — Phase 1 (Host-ready)

Quick Hosting (Netlify Drop — free)
1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag-and-drop THIS ZIP file.
3) Netlify will deploy and give you a public HTTPS link like:
   https://<random-name>.netlify.app
4) Open that link on iPad/iPhone/desktop and use the editor.

Alternative (Vercel — free)
1) Unzip, create a new project, and deploy the folder with index.html.

Local Use
- Desktop: open index.html in Chrome/Edge/Firefox.
- iPad/iPhone: hosting via Netlify/Vercel is recommended due to iOS sandboxing.

Notes
- "Share…" uses the Web Share API and requires HTTPS.
- Direct posting to IG/TikTok requires a backend (future phase).
